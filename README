Welcome to procinfo 18!

Procinfo is a small program that gathers some system information from
diverse files under /proc and prints it to the screen. It duplicates some of
the functionality of free(1) and uptime(1). It should work with any kernel
release close to 1.0 or later up to the latest development kernel. (Well, I
haven't actually tried 1.0 for years, but you get the idea.)

Lsdev is a Perl script that attempts to tabulate DMA, IRQ and I/O port
allocation per kernel driver.

Socklist is a Perl script that gives you a list of all open sockets,
enumerating types, port, inode, uid, pid, fd and the program to which
it belongs. Contributed by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@jlab.org>.

A list of changes for this and older versions of this package can be found
in the file CHANGES.

If you have any problems running procinfo under older kernels (from
1.0 onwards), don't hesitate to mail me about it. The code may be an
unsightly mess which should have been re-written from scratch ages ago
if I had thought it worth the effort, but at least we can pride
ourselves on staunchly sticking to backwards compatibility beyond your
wildest dreams.

Thanks to everyone who send bug reports/fixes, commentary, etc.


Have fun,

Sander van Malssen
